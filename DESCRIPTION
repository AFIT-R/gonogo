Description: Implements the three-phase sensitivity testing procedures known
    as 3pod and 3podm as described in Wu & Tian (2014 <DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspi.2013.10.007>) and
    Wang, Tian, & Wu (2015 <DOI: 10.5705/ss.2014.197>). Also implements the D-Optimality-based
    sensitivity testing procedures as defined in Neyer (1994 <DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00401706.1994.10485401>) and
    Ray, Roediger, & Neyer (2014 <DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspi.2013.12.010>). It also
    provides a comprehensive set of functions to analyze and plot sensitivity testing results.

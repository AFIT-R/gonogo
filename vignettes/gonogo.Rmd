## Introduction
(based on `gonogoUserFunctions.docx`)

When designing experiments, the investigator would vary input variables systematically in order to build useful prediction models for the response variables. Therefore, continuous response data is preferred over binary response data since it contains much more information by the nature of pass/fail or go/no-go data. However, in practice, it is not always possible to collect continuous data and binary response information must be used. This is known as sensitivity testing, where the test specimens are subjected to various levels of stress to generate a binary response. There is a great interest in finding efficient ways to gather binary data through dynamic sequential algorithms. This package implements the three phase optimal design (3pod) test and the Neyer test. This procedure can be viewed as a trilogy of "search - estimate - approximate"

## Functions

`gonogo` provides several functions to aid in sequential testing:

| Function | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| `gonogo` | A modern sensitivity test tool to conduct a 3pod (default) test or a Neyer test.
| `fixw`   | Correct an error made in a previous entry.
| `wxdat`  | Sample data sets ready to be graphed.
| `lrmax`  | List features of `w` pertinent to likelihood ratio (LR) confidence intervals and regions
| `nyqrda` | Fit a normal, logistic, log normal, log logistic distribution to a data set produced by a gonogo test. Additionally, produce a graph of the distribution, its density, and the distribution-free pooled adjacent violator (PAV) solution. No graph titles are provided in this call.
| `ptest`  | Provide eight graphs based upon a given gonogo test.

To put these functions to use we load the `gonogo` package:

```{r, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(gonogo)
```

## Starting a Test

To start a 3pod test, the gonogo function has the following arguments: 
```{r, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
gonogo <- function(mlo = 0, mhi = 0, sg = 0, newz = T, reso = 0, ln = F, neyer = F)
```
- `mlo`: The min value $\mu_{min}$ to guess a reasonable range ($\mu_{min}, \mu_{max}$) for $\mu$
- `mhi`: The max value $\mu_{max}$ to guess a reasonable range ($\mu_{min}, \mu_{max}$) for $\mu$
- `sg`: Guess for standard deviation $\sigma_g$, should satisfy: $\mu_{max} - \mu_{min} \ge 6\sigma_{g}$
- `newz`: logical; if `TRUE` creates a new list of sensitivity tests, otherwise it looks for a list, saved as `z`, in the immediate environment. So, reserve `z` for that use.
- `reso`: Specified resolution used in testing.
- `ln`: logical; if `TRUE` test in log(\emph{X}) units
- `neyer`: logical; if `TRUE`, Neyer test is performed, otherwise three-phase optimal design (3pod) test

To just get a 3pod test started the following arguments are needed at minimum:

```{r, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
w = gonogo(mlo, mhi, sg)  
```

For a Neyer test, the same arguments are required as above with an additional argument to enable the Neyer testing:

```{r, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
w = gonogo(mlo, mhi, sg, neyer = T)  
```

Next a `title` entry is requested: make it short and sweet. No need to say whether it is 3pod or Neyer. And no need to say it's done in a log scale either. This information, captured in the call, is automatically attached to the succinct title you provide for later use (e.g. graphics).

A `units` entry is also requested (used in axis labeling).

The bulk of the subsequent inputs will be at a prompt: `Test at X ~ X0. Enter X & R`

X0 is the recommended stress level. The user will provide two numbers separated by a blank. The first number, X, will be the
actual stress level. The second number, R, is the response, which is either 0 or 1.

## Suspending a Test

To suspend a test, just enter an $(X,R)$ pair with $R = -1$; a negative sample size ($n_2$ or $n_3$); or an invalid ($p$,$\lambda$) pair (i.e. $p < 0$, $p > 1$, or $\lambda < 0$).


When asked for 2 entries, make two entries, otherwise the test ends ungracefully.

A successfully suspended (or completed) test is saved in a named list. If the list is named for example `w`, then `w` contains all pertinent information about the sensitivity test.

## Resuming a Test

When tests are suspended gracefully and saved in a list named, for example, `w`, the testing may be resumed by the following two commands:

```{r, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
z=w; w = gonogo(newz=F)  
```

The variable named `z` has special meaning for `gonogo`. With the `newz = F` option, it looks for a list, saved as `z`, in the immediate environment. Therefore, reserve `z` for this intended use.

## Test Phase I

The objective of Phase I is to quickly identify a reasonable experimental range by obtaining some response and nonresponse values and to move the stress levels to create an overlapping patern. Both the 3pod and Neyer tests begin by pursuing a region of overlap whereby the smallest responding stress response level ($y=1$) is less than the largest non-responding stress response level ($y=0$). The number of samples required is random and is denoted $n_1$. 3pod includes an additional 1 or 2 samples beyond $n_1$ in its Phase I.

## Test Phase II

Its objective is to choose stress levels to optimize the parameter estimation in the assumed model. Stress levels are chosen sequentially in accordance with an D-optimal design criterion following Neyer(1986). Phase II consists of $n_2$ trials, where $n_2$ is user defined at Phase II startup. An $n_2 = 0$ entry is allowed which would skip Phase II entirely.

## Test Phase III

Phase III stress levels are chosen sequentially according to the skewed Robbins-Munro-Josephs (RMJ) procedure. The user is prompted with three entries:

The first is the number of trials $n_3$. An $n_3 = 0$ entry allows the user to skip Phase III and end the test. Also, a standard Neyer test ends in Phase II with $n_3 = 0$.

The second entry is $p$, which is the RMJ percentile being sought after.

The third entry is $\lambda$, which is the RMJ skewedness coefficient. For values of $p$ near 0, a large $\lambda$ is recommended since this forces an upward bias where bigger upward steps are taken increasing the probability of a response ($y = 1$). For $p$ near 1, a small $\lambda$ is recommended since this forces a downward bias where bigger downward steps are taken increasing the probability of a non-response ($y = 1$).

## Limitations

`gonogo` testing analyses rely mostly on maximum likelihood estimation of parameters based on a normal (or lognormal) distribution. To help make up for this limitation, `nyqrda` can be used.

In `nyqrda`, confidence limit tables are provided whose rows contain, from left to right, the following six entries:

 - `ql`: the lower confidence limit of the quantile $q$
 - `q`: the point estimate of the quantile $q$
 - `qu`: the upper confidence limit of the quantile $q$
 - `pl`: the lower confidence limit of the percentile $p$
 - `p`: the point estimate of the percentile $p$
 - `pu`: the upper confidence limit of the percentile $p$
 
## 3pod Implementation

Phase I1 has been modified (by Wu, et. al.) from the original procedure to accelerate the expected time to exit when a poor choice of `mlo`, `mhi`, and `sg` are made. This modified 3pod is incorporated into `gonogo`. It was also found that Phase III wasn't invariant under a rescaling of stresses. So, a fix for this problem has been proposed by Wu, et. al. and is incorporated in `gonogo`. These several developments alters the published 3pod example from the Wu & Tian(2013) 3pod paper as follows (changes in bold):

__11.71060* __ was used to begin Phase III with the paper's value. The Gonogo recommendation of 11.71214 is the value we would recommend here.   

The following plot uses data provided in the Wu & Tian(2013) 3pod paper. The plot will be generated at every keyboard entry. The various phases of a particular test are indicated. Upon test completion, there will appear on the right margin a small black bar on the inside border of the graph. This indicates the location of the next recommended stress level had the test continued. If the test completed Phase III, the maximum likelihood estimates of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are used to estimate the percentile of interest $p$ (this was entered at the start of Phase III). This value will be indicated by a small black bar outside the border of the graph.
